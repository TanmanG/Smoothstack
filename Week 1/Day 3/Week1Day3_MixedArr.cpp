// Prompt 3A. Arrays are great choices for working with fixed data sizes, while vectors are a better choice for more
// dynamic sets of information (as they can grow/shrink). Due to the limited and structured nature of Arrays, they
// are easy to sort and always have perfect random access efficiency. Their downside is that they are immutable in
// size, can only store one type, and always uses a fixed number of elements (i.e. the declared size of the array).

// Prompt 4. push_back() is extremely efficient as it makes use of vector::back, which is a pointer to the back-most
// element. Furthermore, there is no re-shuffling of other elements required freeing the efficiency to O(1).
